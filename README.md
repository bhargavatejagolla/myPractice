# üêç First-Year Python Practice & Experiments

Welcome! üëã  
This repository is a complete collection of my **Python learning and practice work** from my **first year of engineering**.  
It includes **hundreds of problems, mini-projects, and experiments** written while I was learning programming fundamentals, data structures, OOP, and basic software development.

## üìò About This Repository

While learning Python, I kept experimenting in single files ‚Äî  
commenting out older programs and writing new ones in the same script.  
That‚Äôs why many files contain **multiple commented sections**.  
Each block represents a different topic, concept, or exercise I practiced at that time.

Think of this repo as a **timeline of growth** ‚Äî from basic syntax to complex concepts like:
- Functions, recursion, and loops  
- Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries  
- Classes, inheritance, and OOP  
- File handling and exception handling  
- NumPy, Matplotlib, and data visualization  
- Threading, semaphores, and concurrency  
- Turtle graphics and PyQt5 GUI  
- Mini projects (games, calculators, timers, hangman, etc.)  
- Basic sound recording and file I/O  
- Pattern printing, math algorithms, and problem-solving

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

Since most programs are commented, you can:
1. Open any `.py` file.
2. Uncomment the block of code you want to run.
3. Execute it in your IDE or terminal:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
