# 🐍 First Year Python Practice Programs

This repository contains my first-year Python practice work — a collection of small programs, data structure implementations, and algorithm exercises I wrote while learning Python fundamentals and problem solving.

### 🚀 Topics Covered
- Fibonacci Series (loop & recursion)
- Sorting Algorithms (Selection, Bubble, Quick, Merge, Counting, Radix)
- Linked Lists (Single, Double, Insertion, Deletion, Traversal)
- Stacks and Queues (both list-based and class-based)
- Matrix Operations
- String & Palindrome problems
- Recursion exercises
- Basic problem-solving from competitive coding

### 🧩 Structure
All programs are kept in a single file `asd.py` showing progression from simple logic to data structures.

### 🏫 About
These programs were written during my **first year of engineering** as part of my learning journey in Python and DSA.
